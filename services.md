We currently provide virtual Reiki sessions. We offer sessions for 30 minutes, 45 minutes, or 60 minutes. If this is your first time booking with us, we recommend booking for 60 minutes. The 45-minute and 60-minute sessions take place over Google Meet. The 30-minute session is asychronous, meaning we don't meet over Google Meet during the session. Instead, I do your session alone and can share either a recording of the session and/or a summary of the session over email.
