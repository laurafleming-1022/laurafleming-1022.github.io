Hi friends! I’m Laura, the founder of Lotus Blossom Reiki. I’m a certified Reiki II level practitioner. I'm currently working on my Reiki III level certification. Reiki has become an invaluable tool in my toolbox to help my chronic back pain and overall emotional well-being. I’d love to help you explore how Reiki can support you on your journey.
