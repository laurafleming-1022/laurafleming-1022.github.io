Q: How does Reiki work?

A: Reiki is a universal healing energy that all of us are connected to and all of us can access at any time. The Reiki practitioner helps channel Reiki during a session. Reiki flows wherever it needs to. 

Q: Wow, that sounds really “woo-woo”! How does it really work?

A: There are a lot of different mechanisms that I believe are working in tandem to make Reiki so powerful. These include nervous system regulation, endocrine system regulation, fascia, electromagnetic waves from the brain and the heart, neuroplasticity, etc. I’ll be writing more in-depth blogs going over each element, so stay tuned!

Q: What sorts of things can Reiki help with?

A: Reiki has helped clients with depression, anxiety, pain management, and more.

Q: Why are you named “Lotus Blossom Reiki?”

A: Many Buddhists bow as a form of greeting. This has different meanings for different people. One meaning is that the hands represent a beautiful lotus blossom, which we are offering as a gift to the other person. Another meaning is that one hand represents the mind, and one hand represents the body, and we are bringing them together. To me, a lotus represents the beautiful gift of bringing your mind and body together, offering your true presence to yourself and those around you. 

Q: Why is a virtual Reiki session less expensive than an in-person session?

A: The in-person sessions have an additional fee to cover the costs associated with renting a studio space. The virtual sessions do not have this fee.

Q: Why is your Reiki bundle for six sessions?

A: This bundle was designed based on this paper, which showed that six weekly Reiki treatments had significant effects on depression and anxiety over placebo Reiki, even after one year of receiving treatment. This bundle is intended that you have the six treatments within a 6-12 week period for maximum effect, but you are free to use them at your own pace.

Q: My PDF viewer won’t let me fill out your appointment form. What should I do?

A: Unfortunately our fillable forms don’t work with all PDF viewers. We recommend Preview or Adobe Acrobat. If that doesn’t work, you can fill out a paper copy at your appointment.

Q: Can I book an appointment outside of your available working hours?

A: Maybe! Try emailing [hello@lotusblossomreiki.com](mailto:hello@lotusblossomreiki.com) to see if we can accommodate your schedule. A virtual session is generally easier to accommodate than an in-person session
